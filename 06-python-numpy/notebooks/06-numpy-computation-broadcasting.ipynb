    "Broadcasting is a set of rules that allow us to apply *binary* ufuncs, like addition, subtraction and multiplications, on arrays of different sizes. This is a powerful concept that can be incredibly useful if understood, or can lead to a total mess or copious error messages when applied without a concrete understanding of what is happening.\n",
